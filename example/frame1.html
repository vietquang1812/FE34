                <p>Today, JavaScript is used on most of the pages of a modern website, from small individual sites to
                    the largest commercial sites. And wherever JavaScript is used, you’ll also find jQuery.
                    <br><br>
                    That’s why every web developer should know how to use JavaScript and jQuery for what they do best.

                    <p class="answer">If you aren’t able to find your order confirmation email with your order number,
                        contact our Customer support team at support@blockofgear.com, and let us know the email address
                        you used to place the order so we can locate the order number for you.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">2. Can I change my delivery address?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">All prices are in United States Dollars (USD). The Estimated Order Total in the
                        cart and the Cart Summary at checkout will both show the order total in USD.
                        <br><br>
                        Keep in mind, the charge will be converted to your local currency by your payment processor-
                        your card company or PayPal depending on your payment method. If you are uncertain how the
                        currency conversion will work, we recommend contacting your payment company for more details.
